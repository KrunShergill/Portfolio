        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm (currently) a 28 year old Contract Manager in the public sector, but my goal and aim is to completely retrain to become a Software Developer. I have such a huge passion for tech that started in gaming from a very early age (4!), I've been hooked since. It is such an exciting space and industry to be in, the rate of evolution and discovery is unmatched.
